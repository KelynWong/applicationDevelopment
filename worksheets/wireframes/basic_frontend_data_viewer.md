# Wireframe & Justification

This document should help you explain how your user interfaces are designed. You should have a wireframe to give a good overview and some screenshot with simple writeups to justify your designs.

#### Good Points

1. Allows the user to filter out what they are finding instead of going through the whole table of data.
2. Clear placeholders which lets the user know what to key in for each input box.

#### Bad Points

1. Users are only limited to three filtering attributes.
2. All of the input boxes have to be filled then able to filter.

### Justification 2 (Entries per page)

#### Good Points

1. Allows user to limit the amount of data they want to see at once.
2. Easy to understand and use.
3. Enables faster loading time as not retrieving all data at once.

#### Bad Points

1. The options are pre-set and users only able to use those options(e.g. 5, 10, 20 entries per page options).
2. User's might not want to be limited to a certain amount of entries.

### Justification 3 (Pagination)

#### Good Points

1. Allows user's to go on to the next or previous page if data overflows due to entries per page and too much data.
2. It enables the user to click to whatever page they desire(some pagination only have next and previous).
3. Pagination at the bottom of the page which is common and hence they would be familiar to it and use it easily.

#### Bad Points

1. The buttons are a bit too small.
2. A table in a table is very messy and confusing.
