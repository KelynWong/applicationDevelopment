# Wireframe & Justification

This document should help you explain how your user interfaces are designed. You should have a wireframe to give a good overview and some screenshot with simple writeups to justify your designs.

## Wireframe

> This is just an example, please find your own wireframe.

#### Good Points

1. Gives user all the options that they can filter out
2. Options are specific
3. Each filter has a dropdown menu to save space

#### Bad Points

1. Takes up the whole screen
2. User might just want to browse all items

### Justification 2 (Data table)

#### Good Points

1. Table layout the data neatly
2. Alternating table row colour which help the user see each row clearly
3. User can view the data of different column using the dropdown

#### Bad Points

1. Table is cut off and user is unable to see all data at once
2. When data overflows, it creates more pages but it is not really clear of that

### Justification 3 (Pagination)

#### Good Points

1. It enables the user to click to whatever page they desire(some pagination only have next and previous)
2. Pagination clearly shows what page you are on and which button you can click
3. Data is conveyed in neat rows

#### Bad Points

1. The search bar is at the bottom which users aren't accustomed to
2. There can be a title on top like 'Location name' and 'Favourites' and 'Distance'
